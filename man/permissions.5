.SH "NAME"
permissions \- manage system wide file permission settings
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
The permctl(8) program sets permissions and ownerships of files according to the permission configuration files described in this manual page\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "File Format"
.sp
The files /usr/share/permissions/permissions\&.* are line based and whitespace delimited\&. Lines starting with \*(Aq#\*(Aq are comments\&. A permissions entry consists of lines of the following format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
:package: pkg1[,pkg2\&.\&.\&.]
/path/to/file user:group 0755
 +capabilities cap_net_admin=ep
 +acl user:somebody:rwx
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The main part of an entry is the file path specification as seen in the second line, which consists of three whitespace separated columns:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The first column specifies the file path\&. Directory paths must end with a slash\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The second column specifies the designated file owner and group delimited by a
\*(Aq:\*(Aq
character\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The third column specifies the designated file mode in octal\&.
.RE
.sp
Basic file entries can be extended by immediately following lines starting with +<keyword>\&. The following keywords are supported:
.PP
\fB+capabilities\fR
.RS 4
grant Linux capabilities to the file\&. The string specified here must conform to the rules found in
\fIcap_from_text(3)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB+acl\fR
.RS 4
grant additional access control list (ACL) entries to the file\&. The string specified here must conform to the rules found in
\fIacl(5)\fR
(section ACL TEXT FORMS)\&. The ACL entries will be merged with the basic octal file mode, therefore they must not contain any permissions for the file owner, group or other\&. If a file has extended ACL entries assigned on disk, but none are configured in the permissions configuration, the extended ACL entries will be removed by
permctl(8)\&.
.RE
.sp
The optional :package: directive allows to restrict following path entries to files owned by the given comma separated list of packages\&. The designated permissions will then only be assigned to the target file if it is owned by one of the specified packages according to the RPM system database\&. This setting is in effect for all subsequent permission entries in the file until another :package: directive is encountered\&. Entries appearing before any :package: line will always be applied without inspecting target file package ownership\&.
.sp
The file name in the first column of the base entry can contain contain variables as defined in the \fIvariables\&.conf\fR file\&. A variable expands to one or more alternative path segments that relate to the same program or file\&. permctl will look in each possible path resulting from the variable expansion and apply the permissions accordingly\&.
.SS "Path Variable Expansion via variables\&.conf"
.sp
The \fIvariables\&.conf\fR file will ignore empty lines, whitespace only lines or comment lines starting with \*(Aq#\*(Aq\&. All other lines must contain variable definitions that follow the syntax \*(Aqmyvar = /path/1 /path/2\*(Aq\&. This example will declare a variable identified as myvar that will expand to both specified path segments\&.
.sp
Path segments appearing in variable assignments need to be separated by whitespace characters\&. The path values cannot contain whitespace themselves\&. The variable identifier is limited to alphanumeric characters and the underscore character\&.
.sp
To reference a variable in a permissions file, it needs to be dereferenced using the %{myvar} syntax\&. The variable needs to appear as a single path component and cannot be mixed with other literal characters\&. Multiple variables per path are allowed\&. The following are valid uses of variables:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\- %{myvar}/sub/path
\- /parent/path/%{myvar}
\- /parent/path/%{myvar}/sub/path
\- %{var1}/path/%{var2}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
While the following are invalid:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\- /prefix/pre%{myvar}suf/suffix
\- /%{var}text/path
\- /path/text%{var}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Configuration File Locations"
.PP
\fB/usr/share/permissions/variables\&.conf\fR
.RS 4
contains variable expansion definitions\&.
.RE
.sp
The permctl program, when run in \-\-system mode, will assemble a set of configuration entries depending on the profiles configured in \fI/etc/sysconfig/security\fR\&. The order of files parsed (with increasing priority) is as follows:
.PP
\fB/usr/share/permissions/permissions\fR
.RS 4
contains fixed entries independent of the active profile\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB/usr/share/permissions/permissions\&.<profile>\fR
.RS 4
contains the per\-profile configuration of files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB/usr/share/permissions/packages\&.d/\fR*
.RS 4
contains per\-package drop\-in configuration files, which can also exist in fixed or in different profile variants\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB/etc/permissions\&.local\fR
.RS 4
contains local per\-system extra entries or overrides managed by the system administrator\&.
.RE
.SS "Available Predefined Profiles"
.sp
The permissions package ships the following predefined profiles:
.PP
\fBeasy\fR
.RS 4
security settings targeted towards single user workstations, where the only user is also the administrator\&. This profile is tailored towards more simplicity (less configuration and authorization requirements) at the possible expense of security in some areas\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsecure\fR
.RS 4
this is a balanced profile for servers or multi\-user workstations that contains more secure settings at the expense of additional configuration or authorization requirements in some areas\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBparanoid\fR
.RS 4
this is a profile that disables all
setuid
and
setgid
bits and most capabilities\&. It is intended for power users that want to add back individual
setuid
bits via the
\fI/etc/permissions\&.local\fR
file\&. This profile is not intended to be used as\-is, as it will likely break the system without careful tuning\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
This is a demonstration of the use of variable expansion:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# in variables\&.conf
lib_dirs = /lib /lib64
sub_dirs = prog_v1 prog_v2

# in a permissions profile
%{lib_dirs}/%{sub_dirs}/libsomething\&.so root:root 04755
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This will cause `permctl `to try and apply the given permission to all of the following paths, if existing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
/lib/prog_v1/libsomething\&.so
/lib64/prog_v1/libsomething\&.so
/lib/prog_v2/libsomething\&.so
/lib64/prog_v2/libsomething\&.so
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The following example shows the effect of the :package: directive:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# this entry will always be applied regardless of which package owns \*(Aqsome_program\*(Aq\&.
/usr/bin/some_program root:root 04755

:package: sudo
# this entry will only be applied if /usr/bin/sudo is owned by the "sudo" package\&.
/usr/bin/sudo root:root 04755

# this entry would also be applied only if owned by the "sudo" package, since
# no new ":package:" directive appeared\&.
/usr/bin/another_program root:root 04755

:package: su
# with the new package directive this entry will only be applied if
# /usr/bin/su is owned by the "su" package\&.
/usr/bin/su root:root 04755
.fi
